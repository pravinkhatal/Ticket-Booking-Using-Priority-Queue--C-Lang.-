An airline company uses the formula shown below to determine the priority of passengers on the waiting list for overbooked flights.
Priority number = A / 1000 + B – C
where A is the customer’s total mileage in the past year
B is the number of years in his or her frequent flier program
C is a sequence number representing the customer’s arrival position when he/she booked the flight
Given a file of overbooked customers as shown below:

Name Mileage Years Sequence
Avinash Kale 53000 5 1
Archana Patil 89000 3 2
Bipin Mishra 93000 3 3
Sara Farnandes 18000 1 4
Manisha Joshi 76000 7 5
John Brown 65000 2 6
Sakshi Mehta 37000 3 7
Krishna Gandhi 21000 6 8
Deepa Avasthi 43000 4 9
Esha Chopra 63000 3 10

Write a program that reads the file and determines each customer’s priority number.
 The program then builds a priority queue using the priority number and prints a list of waiting customers in priority sequence.
